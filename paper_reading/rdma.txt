#
If you want to send an 8 byte payload using an RDMA write, first you will write the request descriptor to the NIC using Programmed IO, and then the NIC will fetch the payload using a PCIe DMA read. I'd expect both the PIO and the DMA read to take between 200-500 nanoseconds, although the PIO should be faster.
#
You can get rid of the DMA read and save some latency by putting the payload inside the request descriptor.
