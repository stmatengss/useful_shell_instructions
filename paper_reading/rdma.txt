##################
If you want to send an 8 byte payload using an RDMA write, first you will write the request descriptor to the NIC using 
Programmed IO, and then the NIC will fetch the payload using a PCIe DMA read. I'd expect both the PIO and the DMA read to take 
between 200-500 nanoseconds, although the PIO should be faster.
You can get rid of the DMA read and save some latency by putting the payload inside the request descriptor.

Single Data Rate (SDR) - 2.5Gb/s per lane (10Gb/s for 4x). – Double Data Rate (DDR) - 5Gb/s per lane (20Gb/s for 4x). 
– Quad Data Rate (QDR) - 10Gb/s per lane (40Gb/s for 4x). – Fourteen Data Rate (FDR) - 14Gb/s per lane (56Gb/s for 4x).
